There’s no denying that technology now dominates a huge amount of different industries. Being computer illiterate just won’t cut it any more in the world of work. And ‘learning to code’ seems to be the buzzword at the moment. And everyone from Bill Gates to Obama is encouraging young people to give it a go.

But what exactly does learning to code entail? And why is it so important? Read on to find out.

Coding can lead to software development jobs
Coding is the fundamental skill for jobs such as software development. There is currently a shortage of software developers worldwide, so learning to code can be an easy route into an open field of work. However, this isn’t the only way coding can open up job opportunities.

It open up other job opportunities
For smaller start-ups, hiring someone solely to take care of coding and web design may not be the most economically viable choice. Having coding as a string to your bow can be key to finding jobs related to the field (like content creation, marketing, PR and more).

Coding can make your job application stand out
Even if you’re applying for a position which has no direct relevancy to coding, it’s still well known as a useful skill. Thus, by having any knowledge of it, you’ll automatically give yourself a foot up on the competition. On top of it being a generally worthwhile skill in most jobs, it also shows that you’re hardworking, dynamic, and a self-starter.

Coding literacy can help you understand other aspects of tech
Knowledge of coding (or, as some call it, coding literacy) can help in other ways, too. It can mean you are quicker to learn other aspects or tech, plus mean you are more digitally fluent. In today’s ever more digital job market, this can only be of benefit.
